# Statistical Data Analysis

<summary><em>Important notes</em></summary>
<br>
This project is the result of my work on the subject Statistical Data Analysis at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing. I wrote all the code and ran all the experiments presented in the files Tezina.rmd, Rasa.rmd, and Kampovi.rmd. Furthermore, I edited and put together the file ProjektSAP.rmd but parts of that file were written by my fellow group members as noted at the beginning. However, I decided to include this file for the sake of the completeness of our project.

## Introduction
Data I used in this project comes from a well known ANSUR II dataset, which contains 93 anthropometrical measures gathered from the members of the US Military. Overall, there are 6068 data points, 4082 of them are male and 1986 of them are female. On this dataset, I conducted my data analysis. This consisted of hypothesis testing and model building.
